# PyDistort
A command line tool which applies artificial distortion to a given input file


This tool is based on the idea of [Transfer Functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_function). There is a specific function H(s) which is the ratio between the V_i(s) and V_o(s). Most of the theory on Transfer Functions comes from the study of the Laplace Transform; however, this project uses the Fourier Transform because it is easier to compute. 


This is an CLI tool.
